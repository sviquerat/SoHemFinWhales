# Identifying seasonal distribution patterns of fin whales across the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula region using a novel approach combining habitat suitability models and ensemble learning methods
*Viquerat et al. 2022*

## Density surface modelling analysis
 This is the main work flow to produce the figures and tables for the results presented in Viquerat et al. 2022.

 Sripts are designed to run in sequence, i.e. starting with *00 - data prep - covars raster creation* all the way through to *06 - visualise & data export*.
 A number of tables and figures are created over the course of the analysis. File names have been adopted to reflect figure and table order as presented in the manuscript.
